Removes the smiley face created by WordPress.com Stats and JetPack plugins for WordPress by adding a single line of CSS to your header.

== Description ==

The WordPress.com Stats Smiley Remover quickly removes the smiley face that WordPress.com Stats (http://wordpress.org/extend/downloads/stats/) places in the footer of your web pages.

The #9786; (smiley face) character is created by WordPress.com Stats when activated which can throw a number of designs off. The WordPress.com Stats Smiley Remover uses W3C compliant CSS code to remove the character from users screens.
